This project is aimed to develop a model that can efficiently predict the Sales Price of a house based on 79 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of a residential home.

As this is a Regression problem. The project shows performance of several Machine Learning Regression Models such as:
- Linear Regression
- Lasso Regression
- Ridge Regression
- Elastic Net
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boost

### Dataset Description

There are 2 separate files for training and testing the data. Training dataset contains 1469 records and 79 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes and Sales Price as target. The same goes with testing dataset except it does not contain the target variable. This dataset contains information of the residential houses in Ames and Iowa.
